# Flip
Flip is a mobile app project being developed for Vanderbilt's Spirit of Gold Marching Band. It is the semester project for CS 4278.

On a general level, Flip provides an alternative to traditional paper-based information in organizations such as marching band. When the marching band plays at football games, each time a play is run by the football team the band plays a different “pep song.” Because there are so many, it is hard to memorize all of the music for them. Instead, each member of the band is given a “flip folder”, a flimsy little folder containing all of the music that can attach to the instrument while the member plays. Unfortunately, this is a very poor system. The folder often breaks or spills the music, some members don’t receive or lose some of the music, and it is hard to hear during a rowdy football game which song to flip to in the next few seconds so that it can be played. Instead, we are aiming to make the system entirely electronic to prevent all of those issues and open up more functionality as well. Specifically, our app will be designed to be used in Vanderbilt’s Spirit of Gold Marching Band. The Director of Athletic Bands, Dr. Doug Morin, commissioned us to make it for the band. This application will be utilized by the Spirit of Gold for practice, private rehearsal, and both stand and on-field performances in the future.
